        <p>A very rough implementation of Newton-Raphson method to find polynomial roots. Method taken from <a
                href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hubbard/NewtonInventiones.pdf">an interesting research paper.</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The algorithm is recursively defined as $$x_{n+1} = x_n + \frac{f(x_n)}{f^{\prime} (x_n)}$$</p>
        <p>where \(x_1\) is an initial guess. Notably, convergence point depends crucially on inital guess. Finding
            a
            set of
            initial guesses which allow us to find each root is a non-trivial task, mainly
            because a Newton map(which shows us where a particular starting point converges) is a fractal.</p>
        <p>An initial point \(z_1\) is in the basin of a root \(r\) if the sequence \(z_{n+1} = z_{n}
            + \frac{p(z_n)}{p^{\prime} (z_n)}, n \geq 1\) converges to \(r\).

            points don't converge at all.</p>


        This paper gives a recipe to construct a finite set of points such that, for every root, at
        least one of these points will converge to this root.
        Their main breakthrough is that only \(1.11 d \log^2 d\) inital points are required to guarantee the above
        condition, where \(d\) is degree of polynomial.

        <h3>The actual method</h3>

        <p>Because I am too dumb to understand the whole paper(hopefully this changes one day), I just followed the
            recipe given in section 9, aptly named as <b>A recipe for dessert</b>. Here is a small explanation of
            what I
            did
            shamelessly based on the recipe:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Get a polynomial \(p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0\)</li>
            <li>Find a radius \(R\) such that all roots lie within it. We can compute all bounds given on <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_properties_of_polynomial_roots#Bounds_on_all_roots">Wikipedia</a>
                and choose the smallest one.</li>
            <li>Construct \(v\) circles and \(j\) points on each of them placed equidistant to each other. These are the
                initial guesses. The
                specifics
                of
                this step can be read in section 9</li>
            <li>Run newton's algorithm till we get \(p(x) < 0.000001\) or till we reach a certain number of cycles
                    without convergence.</li>
            <li>Because coefficients of \(p(x)\) are real, we are guaranteed that \(\overline{z}\) is a root if \(z\) is
                a root.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="todo">
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Very rarely, some roots are not found due to precision issues.</li>
            <li>If you switch to another tab in browser, the process halts</li>
            <li>Javascript is unoptimized: C++ code can easily compute roots of polynomials till degree 40</li>
            <li>Cannot pause and resume the process to find partial set of roots.</li>
        </ul>
