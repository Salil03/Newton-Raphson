        <p>A very rough implementation of Newton-Raphson method to find polynomial roots. Method taken from <a
                href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hubbard/NewtonInventiones.pdf">an interesting research paper.</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The algorithm is recursively defined as $$x_{n+1} = x_n + \frac{f(x_n)}{f^{\prime} (x_n)}$$</p>
        <p>where \(x_1\) is an initial guess. Notably, convergence point depends crucially on inital guess. Finding
            a
            set of
            initial guesses which allow us to find each root is a non-trivial task. Mainly
            because a Newton map(which shows us where a particular starting point converges) is a fractal.</p>
        <p>An initial point \(z_1\) is in the basin of a root \(r\) if the sequence \(z_{n+1} = z_{n}
            + \frac{p(z_n)}{p^{\prime} (z_n)}, n \geq 1\) converges to \(r\).

            points don't converge at all.</p>


        This paper gives a recipe to construct a finite set of points such that, for every root of every such
        polynomial, at
        least one of these points will converge to this root.
        Their main breakthrough is that only \(1.11 d \log^2 d\) inital points are required to guarantee the above
        condition, where \(d\) is degree of polynomial.

        <h3>The actual method</h3>

        <p>Because I am too dumb to understand the whole paper(hopefully this changes one day), I just followed the
            recipe given in section 9, aptly named as <b>A recipe for dessert</b>. Here is a small explanation of
            what I
            did
            shamelessly based on the recipe:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Get a polynomial \(p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0\)</li>
            <li>Find a radius \(R\) such that all roots lie within it. \(R = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \left\lvert
                \frac{a_i}{a_n}\right\rvert\). Proof left to the reader :P</li>
            <li>Construct \(v\) circles and \(j\) points on each of them placed equidistant to each other. The
                specifics
                of
                this step can be read in section 9</li>
            <li>Run newton's algorithm till we get \(p(x) < 0.0000001\).</li>
        </ol>
